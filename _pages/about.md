## 🔭 About Me

I am **Kun Zhan**, Cognitive Intelligence Lead at Li Auto and Site Manager of the company’s new U.S. R&D Center.

At Li Auto, I own the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) algorithm roadmap—directing perception, planning, large-scale model training, and vehicle-grade deployment. My work has advanced from end-to-end driving (E2E) and vision-language models (VLM) to the full VLA stack, and I lead world-model research that powers end-to-end simulation, synthetic-data generation, and reinforcement learning.

My mission is to close the gap between breakthrough AI and everyday mobility. By translating cutting-edge computer vision, 3D perception, multimodal foundation models, and reinforcement learning into production vehicles and robots, I strive to deliver safer, smarter, truly autonomous transportation.

## 🌟 Research Interests

- **Autonomous Driving**: Vision-Language-Action(VLA) Model, End-to-end autonomous driving systems, decision-making and planning
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection and tracking, scene understanding
- **3D Vision**: 3D perception, reconstruction, and modeling
- **Large Language Models**: Applications of multimodal large models in autonomous driving
- **World Models**: Environment modeling and prediction, reinforcement learning
