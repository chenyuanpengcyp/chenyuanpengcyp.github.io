## 🔭 About Me

Hello, I'm Kun Zhan. I currently serve as the Cognitive Intelligence Lead at Li Auto, where I lead a team focused on the research and implementation of cognitive models, world models, and reinforcement learning.

My research "ambitions" are vast: autonomous driving, computer vision, 3D vision, large language models, embodied intelligence... Essentially, I'm passionate about any technology that can make vehicles "smarter"! I'm particularly fascinated by implementing cutting-edge AI technologies into robots and vehicles, turning science fiction scenarios into reality and working toward an autonomous future.

For me, technological innovation isn't just about theoretical breakthroughs—it's about practical applications that can genuinely transform how people travel. I hope to contribute to the advancement of autonomous driving technology through continuous exploration.
