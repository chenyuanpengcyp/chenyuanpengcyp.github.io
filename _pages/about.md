## 🔭 About Me

I’m **Yuanpeng Chen**, a senior algorithm expert and team leader specializing in architecting and deploying production-ready autonomous driving systems. My work focuses on bridging the gap between frontier research in End-to-End architectures, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, and World Models, and the rigorous demands of mass production. I specialize in the full lifecycle of algorithm development, from conceptual design and team leadership to hands-on optimization of large model inference engines on automotive-grade hardware.

My career has been a progression of increasing responsibility, from foundational research on neural network efficiency to leading a core vision team from scratch (0 to 1). I have a proven track record of delivering state-of-the-art systems, including BEV perception solutions that are now running on production vehicles.

> My mission is to build true embodied intelligence for the physical world, using autonomous driving as the proving ground. I focus on creating AI systems that develop a causal and predictive understanding of their environment, enabling them to anticipate and navigate the complexities of real-world interactions safely and intuitively.

### Key Highlights

- **Production-First Architecture**: Architected FastBEV++, a state-of-the-art BEV perception framework designed for deployment. Achieved real-time performance (10 FPS) on low-power automotive SoCs and pioneered a "OneModel" cross-platform deployment strategy that requires no custom operators.
- **End-to-End System Development (0 to 1)**: Architected and led the full R&D lifecycle of a unified End-to-End perception system, taking it from initial concept to a production-validated framework.
- **Award-Winning VLM Application**: Led my team to win First Prize at the PRCV 2024 DriveLM Challenge by building an advanced decision-making system leveraging InternVL-6B, LoRA, and RLHF techniques.
- **Hardware-Aware Performance Optimization**: Achieved up to 2x inference acceleration on low-power automotive SoCs (e.g., MTK8665) using advanced quantization-aware training (QAT), demonstrating deep expertise in model deployment.


## 🌟 Research Interests

- **Autonomous Driving:**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, End-to-End Driving Systems
- **World Models & Simulation**: Dynamic scene understanding, generative simulation, and reinforcement learning at scale 
- **Deployable AI**: Large Model Inference Engine optimization, model compression, and bridging the gap between algorithmic performance and on-vehicle deployment
