## 🔭 About Me

I’m **Kun Zhan**, Senior Director of Li Auto’s Vision-Language-Action (VLA) organization and Site Manager of the company’s Silicon Valley R&D center. I build scalable teams that take frontier research in multimodal models, reinforcement learning, and world modeling all the way into mass-production vehicles.

My journey started with a master’s degree in Automation from Beihang University, followed by leading Baidu Apollo’s behavior prediction team. Since joining Li Auto in 2021, I have been responsible for architecting and deploying three generations of autonomous-driving stacks, culminating in the current VLA framework that unifies large-model cognition with automotive-grade reliability.

> My mission is to realize physical-world AGI, with autonomous driving as the proving ground for safe, embodied intelligence.

### Key Highlights

- **Scaled leadership**: Direct a 100+ person global org spanning perception, prediction, planning, simulation, and foundation-model training.
- **Production impact**: Delivered Highway NoA (2022), City NoA (2023), End-to-End + VLM dual-system (2024), and the new VLA stack (2025) to mass-produced Li Auto vehicles.
- **Global footprint**: Built Li Auto’s U.S. research hub, aligning Silicon Valley exploration with Beijing HQ execution.

## 🌟 Research Interests

- **Autonomous Driving**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, end-to-end driving systems, decision-making and planning
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection/tracking, scene understanding, BEV perception
- **3D & World Models**: Dynamic scene reconstruction, generative simulation, reinforcement learning at fleet scale
- **Multimodal LLMs**: Applying large vision-language models to cognition, planning, and driver-vehicle interaction

## 💼 Work Experience

### **Li Auto** | Apr 2021 – Present
**Senior Director, Head of VLA Models & Algorithm Owner**
- Built Li Auto’s end-to-end autonomous stack from scratch, progressing from E2E → VLM → VLA architectures that now operate on hundreds of thousands of customer vehicles.
- Assemble and mentor a 100+ member org across perception, planning, foundation models, simulation, and on-vehicle deployment with a strong applied-research culture.
- Established a dedicated world-model and RL group to accelerate closed-loop learning and reduce real-world testing costs by double digits.

**Site Manager, U.S. R&D Center (San Jose, CA)**
- Launched Li Auto’s overseas research hub, covering local strategy, budgeting, and talent acquisition.
- Bridge Silicon Valley innovation with Beijing execution by running cross-border program reviews, ensuring roadmaps stay synchronized.

### **Baidu Apollo** | Apr 2016 – Mar 2021
**Algorithm Lead, L4 Prediction & Planning**
- Led the L4 prediction pre-decision algorithms for robo-taxi pilots, improving motion-forecasting reliability for complex urban interactions.
- Shipped planning-and-control modules and deep-learning onboard components that powered Baidu’s autonomous fleets in Beijing and Guangzhou.
